    "SET-COVERING PROBLEM\n",

    "The set covering problem is a significant NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a collection of elements, the set covering problem aims \n",
    "to find the minimum number of sets that incorporate (cover) all of these elements. In the set covering problem, two sets are given: a set {U} of elements \n",
    "and a set {S} of subsets of the set {U}. Each subset in {S} is associated with a predetermined cost, and the union of all the subsets covers the set \n",
    "{U}. This combinatorial problem then concerns finding the optimal number of subsets whose union covers the universal set while minimizing the total cost.\n",

    "SOLUTION SPACE\n",

    "What is a state? In this problem a state should be composed of 2 groups: one contains all the taken sets the other one the not taken. Each set contains a\n",
    "specific number of elements. \n",
    "We will need a function that checks for the goal state.\n",
    "We will use a path searching algorithms."
